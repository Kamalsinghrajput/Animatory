     fame, and power to earn the title of Pirate King. When he was captured and
      about to be executed, he revealed that his treasure called One Piece was 
      hidden somewhere at the Grand Line. This made all people set out to search 
      and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever found the location of
       Gol D. Roger's treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous a place to 
       overcome. Twenty-two years after Gol D. Roger's death, a boy named
        Monkey D. Luffy decided to become a pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's
         treasure to become the next Pirate King. `,

    defeat enemies with a single punch. But being just one hero in a world 
    filled with them, his life is empty and hollow: he gets no respect from
