    High School echo with the endless bickering and intense debate
    between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable
    confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no
    challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade
    sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely

    desc: `Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by
     monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide
      in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants
       truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born
        out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure
         their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within 
         defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a 
         single titan encounter.`,
